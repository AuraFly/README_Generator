  # Installation
  The user must have the inquerer npm package installed.

  # Usage
  Navigate to the project directory using a terminal and run 'node index.js'. This will kick off the inquirer script that will ask several questions. Answer them as best possible. If you do not know how to answer a question, you can leave it blank.
